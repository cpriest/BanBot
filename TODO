bug: specifying -d -dc all --logfile="" still logs some entries to the default logfile??

idea: bb console
	interactive console for testing rules against emails
		show message [num]		show message(s)
		list messages			list message(s) stored for console work
		list rules				lists active rules in effect for console
		delete [num] | all		deletes the given message [num] or all from console storage
		test [num] | all		tests the stored message [num] or all against rules
		clear rules				clears all rules from console session
		remove rule [num]		removes the given rule from the rule list (console session)
		add rule {rule}			adds the given rule to end of the rule list (console session)
		prepend rule {rule}		inserts the rule at the head of the rule list (console session)
		help					shows console help

	+ fwd as attachments to bb-console@example.com  -> stores attachments to disk for working in bb console

idea: bb-test@example.com
		tests attached messages against existing rules and returns email with results
